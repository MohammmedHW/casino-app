        <h1 className="text-3xl font-bold mb-4 text-red-600">Responsible Gambling</h1>
        <p className="mb-4">
          At Mr Gambler, we are committed to promoting responsible gambling. Gambling should be a source of entertainment and not a means to earn money. We strive to create a safe and enjoyable environment for our users.
        </p>

        <h2 className="text-xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-2 text-red-600">1. Know Your Limits</h2>
        <p className="mb-4">
          Responsible gambling starts with knowing your limits. Set time and budget constraints before you begin gambling. Never gamble more than you can afford to lose.
        </p>
        <p className="mb-4">
          It's important to take regular breaks and keep track of the time spent playing. Monitoring your emotions is also vital—don’t gamble when you're upset or under the influence.
        </p>

        <h2 className="text-xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-2 text-red-600">2. Self-Assessment Tools</h2>
        <p className="mb-4">
          We offer a self-assessment test to help you understand your gambling behavior. This simple questionnaire can help identify signs of problem gambling.
        </p>

        <h2 className="text-xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-2 text-red-600">3. Deposit and Loss Limits</h2>
        <p className="mb-4">
          Users can set daily, weekly, or monthly deposit limits to help control their spending. Loss limits are also available to restrict the amount of money you can lose within a given timeframe.
        </p>

        <h2 className="text-xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-2 text-red-600">4. Time Limits and Session Reminders</h2>
        <p className="mb-4">
          Set time-based reminders to help manage the duration of your gambling sessions. These reminders help you stay in control and take necessary breaks.
        </p>

        <h2 className="text-xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-2 text-red-600">5. Self-Exclusion Options</h2>
        <p className="mb-4">
          If you feel your gambling is becoming a problem, you can request a temporary or permanent exclusion from our platform. During this time, your account will be inaccessible and you won't receive promotional material.
        </p>
